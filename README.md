# üïπÔ∏è Remote SSH

Adds seamless support for working with remote files in Neovim via SSH, SCP, or rsync protocols, with integrated Language Server Protocol (LSP) and TreeSitter support. This plugin handles the complexities of connecting remote language servers with your local Neovim instance, allowing you to work with remote projects as if they were local.

> [!NOTE]
> This plugin takes a unique approach by running language servers on the remote machine while keeping the editing experience completely local. This gives you full LSP features without needing to install language servers locally.

## üîÑ How it works

This plugin takes a unique approach to remote development, given the currently available remote neovim plugins:

1. Opens a "Remote Buffer" - i.e. reads a remote file into a local buffer
2. It launches language servers **directly on the remote machine**
    - A Python proxy script handles communication between Neovim and the remote language servers
    - The plugin automatically translates file paths between local and remote formats
5. File operations like read and save happen asynchronously to prevent UI freezing
6. TreeSitter is automatically enabled for remote file buffers to provide syntax highlighting

This approach gives you code editing with LSP functionality without network latency affecting editing operations.

## üöÄ Quick Start

1. Install the plugin and restart Neovim
2. Open a remote file directly: `:RemoteOpen rsync://user@host//path/to_folder/file.cpp`
    - Or use `:RemoteTreeBrowser rsync://user@host//path/to_folder/`
        - This opens a file browser with browsable remote contents
3. LSP features will automatically work in most cases once the file opens

That's it! The plugin handles the rest automatically.

```lua
{
  "inhesrom/remote-ssh.nvim",
  dependencies = {
    "neovim/nvim-lspconfig",         -- Required for LSP configuration
    "nvim-telescope/telescope.nvim", -- Dependency for some remote buffer telescope actions
    "nvim-lua/plenary.nvim",
  },
  config = function()
    require('remote-ssh').setup({
      -- Your configuration here
    })
  end
}
```

Using [packer.nvim](https://github.com/wbthomason/packer.nvim)

```lua
use {
  'inhesrom/remote-ssh.nvim',
  requires = {
        'neovim/nvim-lspconfig',
        "nvim-telescope/telescope.nvim",
        "nvim-lua/plenary.nvim"
    },
  config = function()
    require('remote-ssh').setup({
      -- Your configuration here
    })
  end
}
```


## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

Here's a default configuration with comments explaining each option:

```lua
require('remote-ssh').setup({
  -- Optional: Custom on_attach function for LSP clients
  on_attach = function(client, bufnr)
    -- Your LSP keybindings and setup
  end,

  -- Optional: Custom capabilities for LSP clients
  capabilities = vim.lsp.protocol.make_client_capabilities(),

  -- Custom mapping from filetype to LSP server name
  filetype_to_server = {
    -- Example: Use pylsp for Python (default and recommended)
    python = "pylsp",
    -- More customizations...
  },

  -- Custom server configurations
  server_configs = {
    -- Custom config for clangd
    clangd = {
      filetypes = { "c", "cpp", "objc", "objcpp" },
      root_patterns = { ".git", "compile_commands.json" },
      init_options = {
        usePlaceholders = true,
        completeUnimported = true
      }
    },
    -- More server configs...
  },

  -- Async write configuration
  async_write_opts = {
    timeout = 30,         -- Timeout in seconds for write operations
    debug = false,        -- Enable debug logging
    log_level = vim.log.levels.INFO
  }
})
```

## üé• Examples

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Caveats

- Language servers must be installed on the remote machine
- SSH access to the remote machine is required
- Performance depends on network connection quality
- For very large projects, initial LSP startup may take longer

## üìù Tips for best experience

1. **SSH Config**: Using SSH config file entries can simplify working with remote hosts
2. **Language Servers**: Ensure language servers are properly installed on remote systems
3. **Project Structure**: For best results, work with proper project structures that language servers can recognize
4. **Network**: A stable network connection improves the overall experience

## FAQ

### Why use this plugin instead of just mounting remote directories locally?

While mounting remote directories (via SSHFS, etc.) is a valid approach, it has several drawbacks:
- Network latency affects every file operation
- Syncing large projects can be time-consuming
- Language servers running locally might not have access to the full project context

This plugin runs language servers directly on the remote machine where your code lives, providing a more responsive experience with full access to project context.

### How does this differ from Neovim's built-in remote file editing?

Neovim's built-in remote file editing doesn't provide LSP support. This plugin extends the built-in functionality by:
1. Enabling LSP features for remote files
2. Providing asynchronous file saving
3. Handling the complexities of remote path translation for LSP
4. Adding TreeSitter support for syntax highlighting
5. Providing commands for browsing and searching remote directories

## Comparison to other Remote Neovim Plugins
I'll search the GitHub repositories you mentioned to verify and improve the accuracy of your comparison.Based on the repository information I found, here's a clearer and more accurate version:

## Neovim Remote SSH Solutions Comparison
1. **remote-nvim.nvim** (https://github.com/amitds1997/remote-nvim.nvim) - The most VS Code Remote SSH-like solution:
   * Automatically installs and launches Neovim on remote machines
   * Launches headless server on remote and connects TUI locally
   * Can copy over and sync your local Neovim configuration to remote
   * Supports SSH (password, key, ssh_config) and devcontainers
   * **Limitations**: Plugin has not yet reached maturity with breaking changes expected
   * Network latency inherent to the headless server + TUI approach

2. **distant.nvim** (https://github.com/chipsenkbeil/distant.nvim) - Theoretically addresses latency:
   * Alpha stage software in rapid development and may break or change frequently
   * Requires distant 0.20.x binary installation on both local and remote machines
   * Requires neovim 0.8+
   * **Limitations**: Limited documentation and setup complexity; experimental status makes it unreliable for production use

3. **This remote-ssh.nvim** (https://github.com/inhesrom/remote-ssh.nvim):
   * Uses SSH for all file operations
   * Syncs buffer contents locally to eliminate editing lag
   * Only requires language server installation on remote (supports clangd for C++, pylsp for Python)
   * Includes tree-based remote file browser (`:RemoteTreeBrowser`)
   * Focused on simplicity and immediate usability

The key trade-off is between feature completeness (remote-nvim.nvim) and responsiveness (this plugin's local buffer approach).
